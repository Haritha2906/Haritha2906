# Demo Instructions for Smart Grid Energy Forecasting Project

This guide explains how to demonstrate your energy consumption forecasting project effectively.

---

## üéØ Objective of the Demo

Show how your system:
- Loads and preprocesses energy data
- Analyzes trends and patterns
- Forecasts future consumption using time series models
- Displays results in an interactive web interface

---

## ‚úÖ What to Prepare Before the Demo

1. Trained model (`trained_model.pkl`) in `model/` folder
2. Flask web app running locally or on Heroku
3. Sample dataset (`smart_grid_energy_consumption.csv`)
4. Jupyter Notebook with EDA and model training steps (optional but useful)

---

## üíª Steps to Demonstrate Locally

### 1. Start the Flask App

```bash
python app.py
```

### 2. Open the Browser

Navigate to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

### 3. Walk Through the Features

- Show the **forecast plot**
- Explain **model used** (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet)
- Point out **predicted values table**
- Discuss key **insights** from the data

## üåê Online Demo (Optional)

If deployed on Heroku or another platform, open the live URL:

```
https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/
```

## üé• Suggested Demo Script

1. **Introduction (1 min)**:
   - What the project is about
   - Why energy forecasting is important

2. **Data Pipeline (2 min)**:
   - Source of data
   - Preprocessing and cleaning steps

3. **Modeling (2 min)**:
   - Which models were used and why
   - How the model was trained and validated

4. **Web App (2 min)**:
   - Show forecast graph and values
   - Talk about how it can help energy companies

5. **Q&A (2 min)**:
   - Prepare to answer questions on model accuracy, future scope, and limitations
